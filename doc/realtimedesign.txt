This is a real-time nostro account visualization system designed for account liquidity management. The system provides near real-time display of account and transaction information, offering essential support for funding needs in business transactions and improving the efficiency of fund utilization. The key features here are real-time capability and data accuracy.
To address real-time performance, we have implemented the following three measures at the system design level:
First, CH was selected as the analytical database. Its features, such as columnar storage, data compression, and sparse indexing, have significantly optimized query efficiency.
Second, a Redis in-memory caching mechanism was introduced, which effectively avoids disk I/O latency and enhances data access speed.
Third, a paginated lazy loading solution was applied to massive real-time transaction data to prevent system performance degradation due to excessively large data volumes.
Ultimately, we achieved a sub-second database response performance under the condition of one million data records and 20 concurrent accesses.
